For years, the idea of creating a website and writing a blog has been
brewing in my mind. As a software developer, I have read many blog articles but
never wrote one. Mainly because of the fear that it won't be good or that I have
nothing meaningful to write about, but this thought is stupid. I achieved every
skill I ever possessed through practice.    
Starting with skill is optional to get good at anything. Additionally, I missed
out on great learning opportunities. 

While preparing lessons as a math and computer sciences tutor at the
[Harz University of Applied Sciences](https://www.hs-harz.de/en/), I often had
to look up specific topics because I noticed that I had a lacking understanding
of some aspects. Even every professor I met had to look up something at some
point. There is no shame in this. You can't know everything, will forget
something over time and only truly understand anything if you can explain it to
someone else as simple as possible.

This Blog will hopefully provide me with similar opportunities. Furthermore, I
finally have an excellent place to document specific topics for myself while
sharing them with anyone interested.

This project finally came about because my talented girlfriend expressed fears
similar to mine about writing posts on LinkedIn, so we teamed up to peer
pressure each other into this endeavour. This website's current state is far
from what I envision (just look at it on a mobile device :sweat_smile:), but it
is a starting point. If you need an opportunity to start the project you have
been thinking about for too long, feel free to join us :grin:

# What can you expect from this Blog?

I want to focus on technical topics (especially about Linux, .NET and my work as
an Ubuntu Maintainer) and share my personal development as a developer. Still, I
like to experiment from time to time, so you may occasionally see topics outside
of this area.
